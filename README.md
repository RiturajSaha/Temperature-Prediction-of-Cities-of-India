# Temperature-Prediction-of-Cities-of-India

This is a Machine Learining approach using the following Regression models-
1) Random Forest Regression
2) Support Vector Regression
3) Multi Linear Regression
4) Polynomial Regression

To predict the temperature of different cities-
1) Chennai
2) Delhi
3) Mumbai
4) Kolkata

on any given date(mm-dd-yyyy)

R Squared value of different models are used to compare them.
R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the goodness of fit of a regression model. The ideal value for r-square is 1. The closer the value of r-square to 1, the better is the model fitted.

The prediction of temeperature of a city is obtained with an accuracy of 0.7058 R Squared value from SVR Model in Mumbai dataset.
